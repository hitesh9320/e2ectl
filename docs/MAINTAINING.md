# Maintaining e2ectl

## Repository Gates

Before pushing or merging:

```bash
make lint
make test
make build
```

Optional live verification:

```bash
npm run test:manual
```

For pre-release smoke checks, also verify a clean-room first-user flow with a temporary `HOME`: import a credential file, save defaults, run `config list`, and exercise read-only node commands against live credentials.

## Source Layout

The maintained v1 tree is:

```text
src/
  app/
  core/
  myaccount/
  config/
  node/
```

Detailed architecture rules live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Keep `app/` bootstrap-only, keep commands thin, and keep formatter-owned JSON output deterministic.
Keep generic API failure handling centralized in `src/myaccount/transport.ts`, and keep node-specific endpoint parsing in `src/node/client.ts`. Cross-domain imports should go through each domain `index.ts`.
Keep config persistence secure and atomic during normal writes, and keep Commander usage-error normalization centralized at the CLI entrypoint.

## CI Contract

GitHub Actions verifies:

- pushes to `main`
- every pull request

Matrix:

- Node 18
- Node 20
- Node 22

Each job runs:

1. `npm ci`
2. `make lint`
3. `make test`
4. `make build`

The manual live API suite is intentionally not part of CI.

## Release Smoke Check

Before calling a branch production-ready, verify:

1. clean install from source: `npm install`, `make build`, `npm link`
2. first-time setup from a clean temp `HOME`
3. `config import` and `config list` behavior
4. read-only live API calls such as `node catalog os`, `node catalog plans`, and `node list`
5. normal repo gates: `make lint`, `make test`, `make build`

## Documentation Duties

Update these when behavior changes:

- [README.md](../README.md) for operator-facing usage
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributor workflow
- [docs/MAINTAINING.md](./MAINTAINING.md) for CI and maintenance policy
- [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible release notes

Any user-visible behavior change must also update unit tests, docs, and the deterministic `--json` output review. The manual live API suite remains opt-in and is never part of normal CI.

## Release Notes

- Keep [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) current for user-visible changes.
- Do not bump the package version unless a release is being prepared.
- Prefer Conventional Commits for history clarity.
- Keep the doc set small: avoid reintroducing milestone-by-milestone implementation history once it is absorbed into the maintained docs above.
