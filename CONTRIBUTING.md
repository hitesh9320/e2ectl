# Contributing

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Local Workflow

```bash
npm install
make lint
make test
make build
```

Useful commands:

```bash
make dev
npm run test:manual
```

## Architecture Contract

This repository is organized as a production-oriented v1 CLI. Keep the source tree in this shape:

```text
src/
  app/
    index.ts
    program.ts
    runtime.ts

  core/
    errors.ts
    json.ts
    mask.ts

  myaccount/
    client.ts
    credential-validator.ts
    index.ts

  config/
    index.ts
    command.ts
    service.ts
    resolver.ts
    store.ts
    import-file.ts
    formatter.ts
    types.ts

  node/
    index.ts
    command.ts
    service.ts
    formatter.ts
    defaults.ts
    types.ts
```

### Domain Ownership

- `app/` is bootstrap only. It wires the Commander program, runtime, stdout/stderr, prompts, store, and MyAccount client factory.
- `core/` contains shared low-level primitives only: errors, deterministic JSON helpers, and secret masking.
- `myaccount/` is transport and credential validation only. `client.ts` stays generic and reusable; do not turn it into a product SDK.
- `config/` owns alias storage, import parsing, default alias/default context behavior, and auth/context resolution.
- `node/` owns node workflows, node create defaults, and node-specific rendering.

### Architectural Rules

- Commands stay thin. `command.ts` files define CLI surface area and delegate business logic.
- Services return typed data. They should not print output or manually serialize JSON.
- Formatters own both human-readable rendering and deterministic `--json` rendering.
- Deterministic `--json` output is a compatibility contract. Review key order, field names, null handling, and sorting before merging changes.
- Import across domains only via that domain's `index.ts`. Do not reach into another domain's internal files.
- Do not introduce placeholder abstractions. If a file or type does not serve the current v1 scope, do not add it.

## Verification Contract

- `make lint` runs formatting checks, ESLint, and `tsc --noEmit`
- `make test` runs unit tests only
- `make build` verifies the production compile
- `npm run test:manual` is for explicit read-only live API checks and stays skipped unless `E2ECTL_RUN_MANUAL_E2E=1`

Do not merge changes without running the relevant local gate first.

## Behavior Changes

Every user-visible behavior change requires:

- unit tests
- docs updates
- deterministic `--json` output review

This includes command help text, prompt/confirmation flow, error wording that operators rely on, and machine-facing JSON fields.

## CLI Error Contract

- `--json` command failures are emitted on stderr as deterministic JSON with this shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "API_REQUEST_FAILED",
    "message": "MyAccount API request failed: ...",
    "details": ["HTTP status: 400 Bad Request"],
    "exit_code": 5,
    "metadata": {},
    "suggestion": "Check the request inputs and try again.",
    "type": "cli"
  }
}
```

- Keep the top-level `error` object stable. Field names, null handling, and key ordering are part of the compatibility contract.
- Preserve the existing exit-code categories. Richer backend details must not silently change `usage`, `config`, `auth`, or `network` behavior.

### MyAccount Error Normalization

- Standard envelope errors: parse `{code, data, errors, message}` and surface HTTP status plus backend `code`, `message`, `errors`, `data`, and extra fields when present.
- DRF detail errors: parse `{detail: "..."}` as the primary failure summary and treat it as backend error content when no `errors` field exists.
- `status_code`-style errors: treat `status_code` the same as `code`, even when it is a string, and preserve extra backend fields such as `status` or `request_id`.
- Malformed or non-JSON API responses: raise `INVALID_API_RESPONSE`, include HTTP status and path, and include a short response-body preview when available.

## Testing Expectations

- Manual live API tests are never part of normal CI.
- CI runs `make lint`, `make test`, and `make build`.
- Prefer unit coverage at the domain level:
  - `tests/unit/app/`
  - `tests/unit/core/`
  - `tests/unit/myaccount/`
  - `tests/unit/config/`
  - `tests/unit/node/`

## Manual API Checks

The manual suite is intentionally excluded from CI. To run it:

```bash
E2ECTL_RUN_MANUAL_E2E=1 \
E2E_API_KEY=<api-key> \
E2E_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> \
E2E_PROJECT_ID=<project-id> \
E2E_LOCATION=Delhi \
npm run test:manual
```

Optional:

- `E2ECTL_MANUAL_NODE_ID` to exercise the live `node get` path

The default manual suite verifies:

- OS catalog discovery
- plan and image catalog discovery
- node list

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes scoped and reviewable.
- Update docs when command behavior, operator flow, architecture rules, or CI expectations change.
- Keep JSON output deterministic for automation.
- Prefer the boring solution over introducing new layers.

## CI Triggers

GitHub Actions runs for:

- pushes to `main`
- all pull requests

The CI matrix covers Node `18`, `20`, and `22`.
